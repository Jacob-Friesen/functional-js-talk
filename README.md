# Functional JavaScript Talk
This is the code that was used for my [Functional JavaScript Talk at Boca JS](http://www.meetup.com/Boca-JS/events/219643723/) modified to be easily runnable from Node.js. If you were not at the talk, it is best to view the [overview slides](http://www.slideshare.net/JacobFriesen/functional-programming-in-java-script-45457849) first.

**Files:**

 * **loops.js:** An introduction to recursion by looping over an array using immutable variables. Then building from there.
 * **immutability.js:** Three ways to implement immutable values in JS.
 * **firstClassFunctions.js:** Implementing a fibonacci function generator using first class functions.
 * **oo.js:** Using first class functions and other functional concept to implement a very simple OO system.
